## Bookend Protocol

### Session Start

1. Read `state/current.md` — where things stand RIGHT NOW
2. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) — recent context
3. If main session: also read `MEMORY.md` — long-term memory

### Checkpoints (every ~30 min or after completing a task)

1. Update `state/current.md` with current state
2. Append significant events to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. If context is getting full: checkpoint NOW
4. Rule: If context compacts, `state/current.md` must be enough to continue

### Session End

1. Finalize `state/current.md`
2. Close daily memory file
3. If lessons learned: update `MEMORY.md`
